## Approach of the project and next steps:
NovaQC Involve [/r/Ubuntu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/) reddit community at each step of the design.

Based on NovaQC's post of [April 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/fyk9uj/my_vlc_yaru_dark_skin_is_ready_to_download_link/), here are the main features NovaQC will try to add for the next release:

- [x] Make the skin resizable (with a maximize button);
- [x] Add Volume button and slider;
- [x] Add more function on the fullscreen;
- [ ] Package the skin in .deb to push the update more easily.
